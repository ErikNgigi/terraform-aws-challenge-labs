## Introduction

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and provision AWS infrastructure in a declarative configuration language. This compilation of AWS Challenge Labs is designed to provide hands-on experience and real-world scenarios for mastering Terraform with AWS.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the challenge labs, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **AWS Account**: Create an AWS account if you don't have one already.
- **Terraform Installed**: Install Terraform on your local machine. Refer to the official [Terraform Installation Guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) for instructions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ErikNgigi/terraform-aws-challenge-labs.git
    ```

2. Change into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd terraform-aws-challenge-labs
    ```

3. Follow the instructions in each lab's README file to complete the challenges.

## AWS Challenge Labs

The AWS Challenge Labs in this compilation cover various Terraform use cases, including:

- **Basic Infrastructure**: Create and manage basic AWS resources like EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and VPCs.
- **Networking**: Implement network configurations using Terraform, including VPCs, subnets, and security groups.
- **Scaling and Load Balancing**: Explore scenarios involving auto-scaling groups and load balancers.
- **Databases**: Provision databases such as Amazon RDS instances and DynamoDB tables using Terraform.
- **Serverless Architectures**: Build serverless applications with AWS Lambda and API Gateway.

Each challenge lab includes detailed instructions and Terraform code to help you learn and practice specific AWS infrastructure scenarios.
